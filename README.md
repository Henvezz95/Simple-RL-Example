# Simple-RL-Example
The repository contains a simple example of Black-Box function approximation using Reinforcement Learning. The technique used is based on the algorithm of [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971), but for this application, the algorithm can be simplified since there are no future states. The final solution is a simple Actor-Critic algorithm that can approximate a continuous Black-Box function with a Neural Network.
